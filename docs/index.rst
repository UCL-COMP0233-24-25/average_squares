Average Squares documentation
=============================

This module contains two functions. The `average_squares` function returns the weighted average of the squares of an array of numbers, with weightings being optionally defined (defaulting to equal weightings).
The other function, `convert_numbers`, converts an array of strings into floats, ignoring any whitespace.
