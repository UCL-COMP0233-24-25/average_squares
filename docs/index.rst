Average Squares documentation
=============================
This module contains two functions. The `average_squares` function returns the weighted average of the 
squares of an array of numbers, with optional weighting (default is to equal weightings). The other function, 
`convert_numbers`, converts an array of strings into floats and ignores any whitespace.
